                              <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website and how it is collected.</li>
                              <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
                              <li>The security procedures in place to prevent the misuse of your information.</li>
                              <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
                            </ol> 
                            <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h4>
                            <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Active collection: information you directly provide to us (such as in forms, email list sign up, or any other form you fill out).</li>
                              <li>Passive collection (third party services): information which is automatically collected while you browse our site. This information is collected and stored by third parties, such as Google Analytics. The information we passively collect includes general data, such as: browser type, device screen size, device type, your browser’s language settings, and geographic location (city, country only).</li>
                            </ul>

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment and utilize a number of security measures to ensure your privacy and safety.</p>
                            <p>However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by email and you do so at your own risk.</p>
                            <p>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information, we take reasonable steps to require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your Personal Information.</p>

                            <h4>Updates</h4>
